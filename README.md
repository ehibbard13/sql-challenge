# sql-challenge

All initial CSV files were provided by UW Madison. 

First I worked on creating a QuickDBD that made sense with the CSV files we were provided. Once I figured out the proper connections I imported the DBD to pgAdmin4. 

Once it was in there I made sure it ran smoothly. I reference stackoverflow to figure out some issues I was having with the forign keys but eventually made it run smoothly. 

After the initial query was running I imported all of the CSVs in the proper order to each of the tables that were created. 

Then I created another query to pull information from the previously created tables and ran each group of code individually to makes sure they were all running as intended. 

After all of the coding was done I saved both of my sql Queries and attached a png screenshot of my QuickDBD.
